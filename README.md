# Power BI Project: Transport  Performance Analysis Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes a transport fleet dataset using **Microsoft Power BI** to track operational performance, fuel efficiency, and costs.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
**Columns:**
- Date â€“ Trip date
- Vehicle_ID â€“ Unique identifier for each vehicle
- Route â€“ Route taken
- Distance_km â€“ Distance traveled in kilometers
- Idle_Time_hr â€“ Total idle time in hours
- Fuel_Liters â€“ Fuel consumed in liters
- Goods_Weight_kg â€“ Weight of goods transported (kg)
- Fuel_Cost_INR â€“ Fuel cost (INR)

## ðŸ›  DAX Measures Created
- Avg Fuel Efficiency (km/l) = Distance / Fuel
- Fuel Cost per km (INR/km) = Fuel Cost / Distance
- Distance per kg (km/kg) = Distance / Goods Weight
- Estimated Driving Time (hr) = Distance / 60
- Idling Time (%) = Idle Time / Driving Time * 100
- Total Distance, Total Fuel, Total Fuel Cost, Total Goods Weight, Total Idle Time

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
- KPI Cards: Total Distance, Fuel, Fuel Cost, Avg Fuel Efficiency
- Bar Chart: Fuel Cost per Route
- Line Chart: Fuel Efficiency Trends
- Pie Chart: Goods Weight Distribution
- Column Chart: Distance vs Fuel Consumption
- Table: Vehicle Performance Metrics

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights
- Identify cost-heavy routes.
- Track trends in fuel efficiency.
- Optimize routes for better load and fuel usage.

## ðŸ“Ž Files Included
- `Transport_Performance_Dashboard_Project.pbix` â€“ Power BI project file
- `Sample_Dashboard_Screenshot.png` â€“ Dashboard preview
- `sample_transport_dataset.csv` 
- `README.md` â€“ Project documentation
